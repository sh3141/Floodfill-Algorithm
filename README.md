# Floodfill-Algorithm
Implemented a flood fill algorithm using c++ for an autonomous maze solving robot for a maze with known dimensions and target cell/destination.  The code takes the maze as input of string and outputs how far each cell is from the node. The drawback of such algorithm is that it requires multiple iterations to find the shortest path to the goal.
